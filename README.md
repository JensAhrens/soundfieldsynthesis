# soundfieldsynthesis

Matlab code for all simulations contained in the book Jens Ahrens, Analytic Methods of Sound Field Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg, 2012

See also http://www.soundfieldsynthesis.org/. 

## Usage

- Download [Chebfun](http://www.chebfun.org/) and unzip it into the Common folder. (You’ll need this only for those scripts that involve Gaussian sampling of the sphere.)
- Start Matlab and add the Common folder and its subfolders to the Matlab path (File -> Set path -> Add with subfolders -> then select the Common folder -> Save -> Close).
- Open the individual scripts and comment or uncomment the parameters that you want to use or that you do not want to use.

Some of my work is based on scripts by Benny Bernschütz and Sascha Spors. The Common package includes the doublefactorial function from the [Special Functions math library](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/978) by Paul Godfrey and the [myspectrogram](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Matlab_listing_myspectrogram_m.html) function by Julius Smith.
